# Mastermind
Creation of an algorithm for resolving Mastermind.

2 solutions : 

- Genetic Algorithm : creation and evolution of a population based on the research paper of Berghman

- Linear : at each round, we delete the non-elgible code and we choose the one which maximise the amount of information given 

Details of the approach : doc : Algorithm de résolution du Mastermind (french)
